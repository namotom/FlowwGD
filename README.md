<p align = "center">A Tool For Prototyping, Simulating & Testing Game Systems</p>

**Projet Status: _In Development_**

### Motivation

<p align ="center">" Your Imagination Should Be The Only Thing Stopping You From Achieveing Greatness."</p>

Game Designing is an interesting line of work, ***but*** if you are familiar with Game Designing then you might also be aware that a Game Designer has to rely on guess work and gut feeling when developing systems for a new game. This can pose as a challenge for new and upcoming designers or hobby enthusiasts, and this challenge will become a nightmare when Game Balancing kicks in.

The lack of a dedicated tool available for all led me to develop **_Floww_**. A tool where you can prototype, stimulate and test your game systems.

### Usecases
Some of the usescases are listed below:
- If you are a ***Hobby Enthusiasts*** or a ***Student***, then it can be a good place to get familiar with designing game systems and testing out your concepts. 
- If you are an ***Indie Developer***, you can use it to test out your game systems way before **Closed BETA** tests. 
- If you are a ***Game Designer***, you can use it to test out your ideas and ultimately build a portfolio for yourself.
